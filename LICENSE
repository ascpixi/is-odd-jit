# is-odd-jit License Agreement
### Inheritance Statement
This License Agreement for the "is-odd-jit" project (the "License") is an extension and continuation of the license terms set forth by the original "is-odd" project. The "is-odd-jit" project inherits its licensing framework, stipulations, and legal enforceability from the "is-odd" project. By accessing, using, modifying, or distributing the "is-odd-jit" software, you acknowledge and agree that this License is bound by and subject to the terms of the "is-odd" project's license.

The original "is-odd" license serves as the foundational legal document governing the use, modification, and distribution of the "is-odd-jit" software. All clauses, conditions, restrictions, and legal obligations contained within the "is-odd" license are fully applicable to the "is-odd-jit" project. Any interpretation, enforcement, or adjudication of the terms of this License shall be conducted with reference to the original "is-odd" license.

For the avoidance of doubt, the rights, responsibilities, and restrictions that apply to the "is-odd" project, as specified in its license, are hereby fully transferred to and incorporated within the "is-odd-jit" project. Users, developers, and distributors of the "is-odd-jit" software are required to adhere strictly to the licensing terms established by the "is-odd" project.

This inheritance of licensing terms ensures consistency and continuity in the legal framework governing the "is-odd" and "is-odd-jit" projects. Any provisions, disclaimers, and conditions originally articulated in the "is-odd" license are fully enforceable within the context of the "is-odd-jit" project. As such, any use, modification, or distribution of the "is-odd-jit" software must be conducted in compliance with the inherited license terms.

It is important to note that the "is-odd-jit" project does not introduce any new licensing terms or modify the existing terms of the "is-odd" license. Instead, it upholds and perpetuates the legal and ethical standards set forth by the "is-odd" project. This ensures that the intellectual property rights, restrictions on usage, and legal disclaimers remain intact and are consistently applied to both projects.

By engaging with the "is-odd-jit" software, you confirm your acceptance of these inherited terms and acknowledge that any legal actions, interpretations, or disputes will be governed by the original "is-odd" license. This acknowledgment reinforces the binding nature of the inherited license and underscores your obligation to comply with its terms.
